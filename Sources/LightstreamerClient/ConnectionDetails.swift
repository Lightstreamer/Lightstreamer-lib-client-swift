     Note that each rebind to the same session can, potentially, reach the Server on a port different than the one used for the previous request, depending on the behavior of intermediate nodes. However, the only meaningful case is when a Server cluster is in place and it is configured in such a way that the port used for all `bind_session` requests differs from the port used for the initial `create_session` request.
